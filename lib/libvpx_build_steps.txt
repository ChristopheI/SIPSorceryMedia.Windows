Building libvpx:
git clone https://github.com/webmproject/libvpx.git

==> 64 bit build
mkdir build-win-x64
cd build-win-64
../configure --disable-static --disable-examples --disable-tools --disable-docs --target=x86_64-win64-vs16
make
Probably fail due to msbuild not in path but should still produce a vpx.sln
open vpx.sln:
 - change "vpx" General->Configuration Type from "Static Library" to "Dynamic Library".
 - set the mdoule definition file, Linker->Input->Module Definition File to vpx.def, the file should have been created by the make step.
change to Release build
